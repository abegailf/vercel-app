                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  When new interactive math problems (PTs) are created based on a request document, they must undergo a rigorous Quality Assurance (QA) process. This involves checking for dozens of potential issues, from mathematical accuracy and pedagogical soundness to strict adherence to localization rules and XML syntax conventions.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Performing these checks manually is not only tedious but also risks inconsistency. Different QA specialists might focus on different areas, leading to a variable standard of quality. I saw a need for a system that could standardize this process and act as an infallible QA partner.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-orange-600">My Solution: A Systematic AI QA Agent</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  I designed the 'QA Workflow Orchestrator,' a command-line-driven AI agent that guides a human QA specialist through a systematic review process. The agent's core is a persistent "Master Feedback Log," a JSON object that meticulously tracks every piece of AI-generated and manual feedback for each problem template under review.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  The specialist uses a series of commands to instruct the agent to run specific checksâ€”from a high-level comprehensive review to granular checks on hint structure, forbidden words, or randomization logic. The agent executes these tasks, displays the results, and automatically collates all findings into the master log, culminating in a final, perfectly formatted report.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  The agent's effectiveness is rooted in its extensive internal library of specialized prompts. I engineered a master "Comprehensive Review" prompt that instructs the AI to act as a collaborative but meticulous QA partner, evaluating content against a multi-point checklist. This is supplemented by a suite of highly-focused "Specialized Check" prompts that allow the user to zero in on specific aspects of quality control, ensuring no detail is overlooked.
