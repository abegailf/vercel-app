                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Our curriculum head, started a discussion in our AI-sharing Slack channel. The idea was to see if we could automate the process of checking answers in our math worksheets. It's a really important QA step, but it takes a lot of time to do manually.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  She had already been running a Python script, but the results were mixed. The AI was good, but it was also making simple mistakes, giving a lot of "false positives." The question for the team was: can we make this process more accurate?

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  For our "AI lab hour," I decided to do some exploring on my own. I took on the task of building my own version of the script to see if I could get better results.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-bold mb-4">My Python script was built to:</p>

                    <li>Clean up and normalize the answers so the AI could understand them easily.</li>
                    <li>Use a detailed prompt to tell the AI to act like an expert math teacher.</li>
                    <li>Send each problem to different AI models (like OpenAI and Gemini) to test and compare them.</li>
                    <li>Collect all the JSON responses from the AI and organize them into a final CSV report for analysis.</li>

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  After running my tests and sharing the results with the team, we confirmed the initial findings. My script worked well, but the AI models were still not consistent enough for this specific taskâ€”they were still flagging correct answers as wrong.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Even though it wasn't implemented, this was a successful R&D project. We learned a lot about the current limits of AI for math validation and made a data-driven decision not to spend more time on it for now. It was a great example of our team collaborating to explore new tech.
